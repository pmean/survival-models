This data comes from Table 2.1 of 

Hosmer DW, Lemeshow S, May S. Applied Survival
Analysis. 2008. John Wiley and Sons: Hoboken, NJ.

This data set is copyrighted, but is reproduced
here under the fair use provisions of copyright
law.

It is used in ~/survival-models/src/survival-
lecture-1.Rmd to illustrate computation of the 
Kaplan-Meier curve. It represents survival times
for a very small subset of data from the 
Worcester Heart Attack Study.

This is a comma-delimited text file with a header
for the variables names. There are five rows and
three columns of data. I converted the variable 
names to initial caps to all lower case.

subject, a sequential number from 1 to 5
time, the time to event (either death or censor) in days.
