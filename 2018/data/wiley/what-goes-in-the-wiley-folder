~/survival-models/data/wiley/what-goes-in-the-wiley-folder

This folder holds data files used in the Hosmer,
Lemeshow, and May book. Because of copyright
concerns, I am not storing these files in my
github repository. You will need to go to

ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/survival/

and copy those files into the data/wiley folder.
Look for the files associated with the second
edition of this book. You can download these
files for your own private use at no charge.
