Preliminaries.

```{r prelims}
library(survival)
```

Read in the WHAS500 data set.

```{r read}
fn <- "~/survival-models/data/wiley/whas500.dat"
whas500 <- read.table(fn, header=FALSE, as.is=TRUE)
names(whas500) <- c(
  "id",
  "age", 
  "gender",
  "hr",
  "sysbp",
  "diasbp",
  "bmi",
  "cvd",
  "afb",
  "sho",
  "chf",
  "av3",
  "miord",
  "mitype",
  "year",
  "admitdate",
  "disdate",
  "fdate",
  "los",
  "dstat",
  "lenfol",
  "fstat")
head(whas500)
```

Produce a table of counts for fstat.

```{r counts}
table(whas500$fstat)
```

Draw a Kaplan-Meier plot for overall survival.

```{r overall-km, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
whas500_surv <- Surv(whas500$lenfol, whas500$fstat)
whas500_km <- survfit(whas500_surv~1)
plot(whas500_km, conf.int=FALSE)
```

Estimate the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles for overall survival.

```{r quantiles}
quantile(whas500_km)
```

Produce a crosstabulation of fstat and gender. Are you comfortable with the number of deaths in each group?

```{r crosstab}
table(whas500$gender, whas500$fstat)
```

Draw Kaplan-Meier curves for males and females.

```{r km-by-gender}
whas500_by_gender <- survfit(whas500_surv~whas500$gender)
plot(whas500_by_gender)
```

Calculate median survival with confidence intervals
for males and females.

```{r q-by-gender}
quantile(whas500_by_gender)
```

Calculate the log rank test for males versus females. Interpret your result.

```{r logrank-by-gender}
survdiff(whas500_surv~whas500$gender)
```

Interpretation: the p-value is less than 0.05, so you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the survival probabilities are different for women versus men.

Produce age groups <60, 60-69, 70-79, and >=80. 
Compute a crosstabulation of this variable with fstat.
Are you comfortable with the number of deaths in each
group?

```{r cutpoints-for-age}
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
age_breaks <- c(0, 59, 69, 79, 99)
age_labels <- c("<60", "60-69", "70-79", ">=80")
whas500$age_group <- cut(whas500$age, age_breaks, age_labels)
table(whas500$age_group, whas500$fstat)
```

Draw Kaplan Meier curves for each age group.

```{r km-by-age}
whas500_km_by_age <- survfit(whas500_surv~whas500$age_group)
whas500_km_by_age    %>%
  tidy               %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, estimate, color=strata)) +
    geom_step()
```

Calculate the median survival time with confidence intervals for each age group.

```{r quantile-by-age}
quantile(whas500_km_by_age)
```

Calculate the log rank test for age groups. Interpret your results.

```{r logrank-by-age}
survdiff(whas500_surv~whas500$age_group)
```


(Only for those who are brave) The following are 
times for catheters in infants. A "+" means that the
catheter was removed because it was no longer needed.
Times without a + mean that the catheter was removed
because it failed. Occlusion and infection were the 
two major reasons for failure. Treating failures as
an event and removal because it was no longer needed
as a censored observation, estimate the Kaplan-Meier
survival curve by hand, showing all your intermediate
calculations.

1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1, 1, 2+, 2+, 2, 2, 
3+, 3, 4+, 4, 5+, 5+, 5+, 5+, 5+, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 
10, 10, 12, 12, 13

First, set up a data frame for the ten time points (1-7, 10, 12, 13)

```{r set-up}
km <- data.frame(
  t=c(1:7, 10, 12, 13),
  n=rep(-1, 10),
  d=rep(-1, 10),
  c=rep(-1, 10),
  p=rep(-1, 10),
  s=rep(-1, 10))
```

We will fill in these numbers soon enough. Here's the key:
  t = time
  n = number at risk
  d = number of failures
  c = number censored
  p = conditional probability
  s = survival probability
  
**1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1+, 1, 1,** 2+, 2+, 2, 2,

10, 10, 12, 12, 13

There are 34 observations total. At t1=1, there are d1=2 deaths and c1=8 ceonsored values. The survival probability is equal to the conditional probability.

```{r t1}

Well, that was a lot of work, but it was worth it.

Let's input the data to check our work.

```{r check}
t <- c(1:7, 10, 12, 13)

t <- c(
  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 
  3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6,
  7, 10, 10, 12, 12, 13)

i <- c(
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 
  0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

catheter <- data.frame(t=t, i=i)
catheter_surv <- Surv(catheter$t, catheter$i)
catheter_km <- summary(survfit(catheter_surv~1))
catheter_km
data.frame(our.calc=km$s, r.calc=catheter_km$surv)
```

They match. Hooray!
