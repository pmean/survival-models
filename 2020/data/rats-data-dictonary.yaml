data-dictionary: rats.csv

  This dataset is available though the survival
  package of the R programming language.
  
description:
  This dataset shows survival times for rats 
  provided an unspecified medical treatment 
  or a placebo. The experiment randomized three
  pups within an individual litter, one to the
  treatment group and two to the control group.
  This data is useful for (among other things)
  showing how to account for a litter effect
  in a Cox proportional hazards model.
  
copyright:
  Because this data is included in the 
  survival package of the R programming language,
  this dataset is free to use with just a few
  restrictions. For details, see

  It should be fine to use this data for
  individual educational purposes. If you do 
  use it in a publicaiton, it would be nice 
  to acknowledge the original source, either

  Analysis in R. R package version 3.1-12,

  The true original source, however, is a book with
  the simple title "Data" written by D.F. Andrews
  and A.M. Herzberg. It was published in 1985, long
  before the World Wide Web made it so much easier 
  to distribute data.
