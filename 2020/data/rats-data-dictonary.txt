This dataset shows survival times for rats provided an unspecified medical treatment or a placebo. The experiment randomized three pups within an individual litter, one to the treatment group and two to the control group. This data is useful for (among other things) showing how to account for a litter effect in a Cox proportional hazards model.

This data is included in the survival package of the R programming language. This entire package, and therefore this dataset, is published under an open source license. It should be fine to use this data for individual educational purposes. If you do use it, it would be nice to acknowledge the original source, either

There are five variables in this dataset:
  litter - consecutive numbers from 1 to 100 identifying specific litters
  rx - indicator variable for treatment
    0 = placebo
    1 = treatment
  time - time until survival or censoring
  status - code for death
    0 = alive at last evalation (censored)
    1 = died
  sex
    f = female
    m = male

The data is available as a comma-delimited text file, rats.csv. There are 300 rows in the dataset, excluding the first row which has the variable names. There is also a version in SAS binary format, rats.sas7bdat. In R is it much easier, once you load the survival package with the library function. You then have access to this file under a data frame named rats.
