source:
  This dataset is available though the survival
  package of the R programming language.
  
description:
  This data dictionary provides information about
  a dataset that for a variety of reasons, comes
  in four different files. Two files of the files
  (transplant.txt and transplant1.csv) are identical
  except for formatting and are represented with one
  row per patient. Another two files (heart.csv and
  transplant2.csv) are also identical except for 
  formatting and are represented using start-stop 
  coding. For these two data sets, an extra row is
  needed for patients who switch the covariate pattern
  in the middle of the study.

  This dataset shows information about heart transplant
  patients. Patients were accepted into a heart 
  transplant program, but many had to wait months
  or even years before a suitable transplant organ
  was found. Some patients never got a heart transplant
  at all. It is useful for (among other things) 
  illustrating start/stop coding for time varying
  covariates.

  Because this data is included in the 
  survival package of the R programming language,
  this dataset is free to use with just a few
  restrictions. For details, see

  It should be fine to use this data for
  individual educational purposes. If you do 
  use it in a publicaiton, it would be nice

  The true original source, however, is a book with
  the simple title "Data" written by D.F. Andrews
  and A.M. Herzberg. It was published in 1985, long
  before the World Wide Web made it so much easier 
  to distribute data.
