  It should be fine to use this data for
  individual educational purposes. If you do 
  use it in a publicaiton, it would be nice 
  to acknowledge the original source, either

  Analysis in R. R package version 3.1-12,

  The true original source, however, is a book with
  the simple title "Data" written by D.F. Andrews
  and A.M. Herzberg. It was published in 1985, long
  before the World Wide Web made it so much easier 
  to distribute data.
