This data set shows how long political leaders of various countries stayed in power and is useful for (among other things) illustrating how to fit competing risk models based on the manner in which each leader lost power. It is described and analyzed in detail in the Paul Allison book, Survival Analysis Using SAS. A Practical Guide. It is a subset of the data analyzed in a 1991 book by Henry Bienen and Nicolas van de Walle, Of Time and Power.

There is no information in Allison's book about copyright restrictions, but you should be able to use this data for individual educational purposes under the fair use guidelines of copyright laws.
