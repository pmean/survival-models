1. Open the WHAS500 data set in the software program of 
your choice.

a. Calculate and graph on the same graph a Kaplan-Meier curve for the three cohorts associated with year. Does it appear as if these survival curves differ? If so, do they appear to violate the assumption of proportional hazards?

b. Calculate and interpret the complementary log-log plots.

c. Calculate, plot, and interpret the Schoenfeld residuals from a Cox regression model with year as the only independent variable. 

d. Fit a Cox regression model with gender as an independent variable and include year as a strata. Create estimated survival plots for each strata comparing males to females.
